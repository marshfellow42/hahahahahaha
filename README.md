# hahahahahaha
A Python script that would delete every file inside every folder (and subfolder) of the directory in which the script is located, with hahaha.md

You need to attach the script in the folder that you want to delete, for it to work correctly

This script was inspired by a faulty USB Drive that I bought for my brother off of Shopee
